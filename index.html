 HTML is made up of elements.
 An element has an opening tag and a closing tag
 Example: 
 <html> </html>
 Opening Tag Closing Tag
 - Within the opening and the closing tag, 
 we could have other elements(children) or text content
 - HTML's structure build a family tree like structure
 - Some elements are self closing e.g. img, input, meta elements
 - Using the correct html elements boost web accessibility and Search Engine 
Optimization.
 - Semantic HTML -- HTML elements that convey a meaning/message about it's 
content to search engines and accesibility tools. 
 Attributes
 - Within the opening tag, we can add information about an element using 
attributes. Attributes have two parts- Attribute name and attribute value.
 Example: in the img element- src(source attribute- contains a url to the 
image file), alt(alterntive text attribute- provides text based description of an 
image for accessibility purpose)
